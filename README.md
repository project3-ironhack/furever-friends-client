# Welcome to our final project done with Ironhack!

## Our project

We decided to make a website where people can look for potential new fluffy friends to take home.

## Why?

In France alone, tens of thousands of pets are abandoned every year, especially in the summer months when people leave on vacation. We'd like to encourage people to adopt pets that need homes. Adopt, don't shop. :)

## What?

With our app, you can see a list of pets available, find out more details about them, and if you sign up and login, you can edit the page or delete it. There are two different kinds of accounts - adopters, and associations. In a future version, adopters will be able to contact associations about the pets they have available for adoption.

# Dev Details

This portion of the webapp was made with React and CSS, no HTML/CSS/JS libraries like bootstrap. We coded the CSS with love and maybe a bit of sweat and tears.

# Run on your computer

## Back-end

You would first need to consult our back-end repository to get the full experience, with you can find [here](https://github.com/project3-ironhack/furever-friends-server).

## Installing dependencies

You will need to do `npm install` in the folder where you'd like the run this project.

### Other npm packages

You will also need to have an account with [cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) to be able to use images on the webapp.

```
# axios for API requests
npm i axios

# react router dom
npm i react-router-dom
```

Environment variables should be the following:

```
# PORT=
The port where you'll run the front-end. 
# REACT_APP_API_URL
API server
```
# Setup

If you don't want to have to run everything yourself on your computer, you can take a look at our site [here](https://fureverfriends.netlify.app/).
